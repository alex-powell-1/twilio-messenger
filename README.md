Twilio Messenger is a lightweight, cross platform (Windows + MacOS) client application for receiving and sending SMS texts
with logging, search capability, user authentication, customer lookup (SQL), and theme customizations

This application works in conjunction with my application twilio-server, which writes incoming messages to a csv
on a network share for reference by the client application.
